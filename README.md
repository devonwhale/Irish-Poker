Simulation of Irish Poker being written in Java

This is a small project that I am working on in Java, and is a simulation of Irish Poker being played by the people I live with. It is not designed to be that big or impressive, but to refresh myself on basic Java.

For those who don't know, Irish Poker is a drinking game with the following rules;

1) Each player is dealt 4 cards face down

2) The players, travelling in a clockwise circle fom the left of the dealer, guess if a card is Red or Black.

3) If the guess is incorrect, they take the amount of drinks required for that card (The value for each number card, ten for an ace and a down for a face), else they nominate someone else to take the drinks.

4) The next time round the players guess if the second card will be higher or lower than the first (Ace is high). If the first card was an Ace or a two, it is replaced a randomly drawn card.

5) For the third card, the players guess if it is inbetween or outside of the first two cards. If either is impossible, the second card is replaced.

6) For the forth card, each player guesses which suit it is.
